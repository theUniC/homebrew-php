# Homebrew-PHP

A centralized repository for PHP-related brews.

## Bugs happen

The more information you provide and the more detailed your report is, the easier for us to fix it.
The best practice in filling a bug report can be seen for this issue https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php/issues/1225.

Please refer to [this section](#filing-bug-reports) for more information.

## Common Issues

Bugs inevitably happen - none of us is running EVERY conceivable setup - but hopefully the install process can be made smoother through the following tips:

- If you have recently upgraded your Mac OS version or Xcode, read [this section](#common-upgrade-issues).
- Upgrade your OS X to the latest patch version. So if you are on `10.9.0`, upgrade to `10.9.2` etc.
- Ensure Xcode is installed and up to date.
- Run `brew update`. If you tapped an old version of `homebrew-php` or have an old brew installation, this may cause some installation issues.
- Run `brew upgrade`. This will upgrade all installed formulae. Sometimes an old version of a formula is installed and this breaks our dependency management. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to force Homebrew to upgrade only those we depend upon. This is a possible fix for those with `libxml` related compilation issues.
- If `brew doctor` complains about `Error: Failed to import: homebrew-php-requirement` or similar, you can find broken PHP requirement files using `find $(brew --prefix)/Library/Formula -type l -name "*requirement.rb"`. Run this with the `-delete` flag if you are sure the results of the find contain only the files producing import failures. You can also remove them manually.
- If you upgraded to Mavericks 10.9.x, please also upgrade to the latest Xcode, 5.0.1 and make sure you re-install Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- On Mavericks 10.9.x, if  `xcode-select --install` displays the error message `Can't install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server.`, download Command Line Tools from [Apple Developer]( https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Command%20Line%20Tools).

- If you are using Xcode 4, install the `Command Line Tools`. If you think you have them installed, please ensure that an update of Xcode or OS X did not remove them. You can verify this by launching Xcode, opening preferences, going to the Downloads tab, and clicking the `Install` button:

- Delete your `~/.pearrc` file before attempting to install a `PHP` version, as the pear step will fail if an existing, incompatible version exists. We try to detect and remove them ourselves, but sometimes this fails.
- Run `brew doctor` and fix any issues you can.
- If you are using Mountain Lion `10.8.x`, please install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) so that the `png.h` header exists for compilation of certain brews. Mountain Lion removes X11, which contained numerous headers. A permanent fix is forthcoming.
- If you upgraded to Mountain Lion `10.8.x`, please also upgrade to the latest Xcode, 5.1.
- File an awesome bug report, using the information in the next section.
- If you have a failing install due to `GD build test failed`, try running the following before attempting to reinstall:

```sh
brew rm freetype jpeg libpng gd zlib
brew install freetype jpeg libpng gd zlib
```

Doing all of these might be a hassle, but will more than likely ensure you either have a working install or get help as soon as possible.

## Common upgrade issues

If you have recently upgraded your Mac OS X version or Xcode, you may have some compilation or missing libraries issues. The following information may help you solve most of the problems:

- Ensure you have properly upgraded CLT depending on your Xcode version.
- Proceed step by step to isolate the responsible formula. If you need to install `php55` and `php55-imagick`, don't do `brew install php55 php55-imagick`. Just do `brew install php55`, ensure everything is working as expected, check the output of `phpinfo()`, restart your Apache server with `sudo apachectl restart`. Then you can install the next formula `brew install php55-imagick`.
- If `php53`, `php54` or `php55` build fails, remove all their dependencies and reinstall the formula. For instance: If `brew install php55` fails, do the following: `brew rm php55 && brew deps php55 | xargs brew rm`. If `brew install php55 --with-gmp` fails, do the following: `brew rm php55 && brew deps php55 --with-gmp | xargs brew rm`. Then reinstall a clean version of the formula: `brew update && brew upgrade && brew install php55`.
- If an extension build fails, try also to remove all its dependencies and reinstall it.
- Sometimes it appears that a formula is not available anymore, do the following: `brew tap --repair`.

### Filing Bug Reports

The best practice for filling bug reports can be found here : https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php/issues/1225.

A blank bug report template can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lucasmichot/413c340c3fd97fef4cc0/raw/ce219a1cf2cd128764fce83628c47bf7e0d8adef/homebrew-php-bug-report-template).

You can also copy/paste this markdown and add it in the description of your bug report:

```
<problem description>

Parameter | Value
------------------ | ------------------
**OS X Version:** | <your OSX version>
**Homebrew Version:** | <your Homebrew version>
**PHP Version in use:** | <your PHP version>
**Xcode Version:** | <your Xcode version>
**Output of gcc -v:** | <result of the CLI output>
**Output of php -v:** | <result of the CLI output>
**Output of brew install -v path/to/homebrew-php/the-formula-you-want-to-test.rb --with-your --opts-here within a gist** | <result of the CLI output>
**Output of brew doctor within a gist** | <the link to your public Gist>
```

Please include the following information in your bug report:

- OS X Version: ex. 10.7.3, 10.6.3
- Homebrew Version: `brew -v`
- PHP Version in use: stock-apple, homebrew-php stable, homebrew-php devel, homebrew-php head, custom
- Xcode Version: 4.4, 4.3, 4.0, 3 etc.
  - If you are on Mountain Lion `10.8.x`, please also upgrade to the latest Xcode, 4.4.
  - If using 4.3, verify whether you have the `Command Line Tools` installed as well
  - If on Snow Leopard, you may want to install the [`OS X GCC Installer`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/)
- Output of `gcc -v`
- Output of `php -v`
- Output of `brew install -v path/to/homebrew-php/the-formula-you-want-to-test.rb --with-your --opts-here` within a [gist](http://gist.github.com). Please append any options you added to the `brew install` command.
- Output of `brew doctor` within a [gist](http://gist.github.com)

This will help us diagnose your issues much quicker, as well as find commonalities between different reported issues.

## Background

This repository contains **PHP-related** formulae for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew).

(This replaces the PHP formulae that used to live under [adamv's homebrew-alt repository](https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt).)

The purpose of this repository is to allow PHP developers to quickly retrieve working, up-to-date formulae. The mainline Homebrew repositories are maintained by non-php developers, so testing/maintaining PHP-related brews has fallen by the wayside. If you are a PHP developer using Homebrew, please contribute to this repository.

## Requirements

* [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
* Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks. Untested everywhere else.
* The Homebrew `dupes` tap - `brew tap homebrew/dupes`
* The Homebrew `versions` tap - `brew tap homebrew/versions`

## Installation

Setup the `homebrew/dupes` tap which has dependencies we need:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/dupes
```

Setup the `homebrew/versions` tap which has dependencies we need:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/versions
```

Then, run the following in your command-line:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
```

## Usage

**Note:** For a list of available configuration options run:

```sh
brew options php55
```

Once the tap is installed, you can install `php53`, `php54`, `php55`, or any formulae you might need via:

```sh
brew install php55
```

That's it!

Please also follow the instructions from brew info at the end of the install to ensure you properly installed your PHP version.

### Installing Multiple Versions

Using multiple PHP versions from `homebrew-php` is pretty straightforward.

If using Apache, you will need to update the `LoadModule` call. For convenience, simply comment out the old PHP version:

```sh
# /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
# Swapping from PHP 5.4 to PHP 5.5
# $HOMEBREW_PREFIX is normally `/usr/local`
# LoadModule php5_module    $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Cellar/php54/5.4.31/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
LoadModule php5_module    $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Cellar/php55/5.5.16/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
```

If using FPM, you will need to unload the `plist` controlling php, or manually stop the daemon, via your command line:

```sh
# Swapping from PHP 5.4 to PHP 5.5
# $HOMEBREW_PREFIX is normally `/usr/local`
cp $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Cellar/php55/5.5.16/homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php54.plist
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist
```

If you would like to swap the PHP you use on the command line, you should update the `$PATH` variable in either your `.profile`, `.zshrc`, `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```sh
# Swapping from PHP 5.4 to PHP 5.5
# export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php54)/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php55)/bin:$PATH"
```

Please be aware that you must make this type of change EACH time you swap between PHP `minor` versions. You will typically only need to update the Apache/FPM when upgrading your PHP `patch` version.

### PEAR Extensions

If installing `php53`, `php54` or `php55`, please note that all extensions installed with the included `pear` will be installed to the respective php's bin path. For example, supposing you installed `PHP_CodeSniffer` as follows:

```sh
pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
```

It would be nice to be able to use the `phpcs` command via command-line, or other utilities. You will need to add the installed php's `bin` directory to your path. The following would be added to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` when running the `php55` brew:

```sh
export PATH="$(brew --prefix php55)/bin:$PATH"
```

Some caveats:

- Remember to use the proper PHP version in that export. So if you installed the `php54` formula, use `php54` instead of `php55` in the export.
- Updating your installed PHP will result in the binaries no longer existing within your path. In such cases, you will need to reinstall the pear extensions. Alternatives include installing `pear` outside of `homebrew-php` or using the `homebrew-php` version of your extension.
- Uninstalling your `homebrew-php` PHP formula will also remove the extensions.

## Contributing

The following kinds of brews are allowed:

- PHP Extensions: they may be built with PECL, but installation via Homebrew is sometimes much easier.
- PHP Utilities: php-version, php-build fall under this category.
- Common PHP Web Applications: phpMyAdmin goes here. Note that WordPress would not qualify because it requires other migration steps, such as database migrations etc.
- PHP Frameworks: these are to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Generally, only a recent, stable version of a popular framework will be allowed.

If you have any concerns as to whether your formula belongs in PHP, just open a pull request with the formula and we'll take it from there.

### PHP Extension definitions

PHP Extensions MUST be prefixed with `phpVERSION`. For example, instead of the `Solr` formula for PHP55 in `solr.rb`, we would have `Php55Solr` inside of `php55-solr.rb`. This is to remove any possible conflicts with mainline Homebrew formulae.

The template for the `php55-example` pecl extension would be as follows. Please use it as an example for any new extension formulae:

```ruby
require File.expand_path("../../Abstract/abstract-php-extension", __FILE__)

class Php55Example < AbstractPhp55Extension
  init
  homepage 'http://pecl.php.net/package/example'
  url 'http://pecl.php.net/get/example-1.0.tgz'
  sha1 'SOMEHASHHERE'
  version '1.0'
  head 'https://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/example/trunk', :using => :svn

  def install
    Dir.chdir "example-#{version}" unless build.head?

    ENV.universal_binary if build.universal?

    safe_phpize
    system "./configure", "--prefix=#{prefix}", phpconfig
    system "make"
    prefix.install "modules/example.so"
    write_config_file unless build.include? "without-config-file"
  end
end
```

Before testing the extension, you will need run the command `brew tap --repair` to create a symlink in `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Library/Formula`.

Before finalizing the extension, run the command `brew audit` to check that your formula respects Homebrew best practice and syntax.

Defining extensions inheriting AbstractPhp5(3456). Extension will provide a `write_config_file` which add `ext-{extension}.ini` to `conf.d`, don’t forget to remove it manually upon extension removal. Please see [abstract-php-extension.rb](Formula/abstract-php-extension.rb) for more details.

Please note that your formula installation may deviate significantly from the above; caveats should more or less stay the same, as they give explicit instructions to users as to how to ensure the extension is properly installed.

The ordering of formula attributes, such as the `homepage`, `url`, `sha1`, etc. should follow the above order for consistency. The `version` is only included when the URL does not include a version in the filename. `head` installations are not required.

All official PHP extensions should be built for all stable versions of PHP included in `homebrew-php`. These versions are `5.3.29`, `5.4.31` and `5.5.16`.

Please also consider adding PHP extensions for PHP 5.6: `5.6.0-rc4`.
